# Computer-Vision
This repo Involves project on computer vision techniques for tracking and localization 


Finding someone lost at sea is a difficult task. Even when a “man over board” situation is timely detected, and the
person is spotted nearby a vessel, keeping track of that person is difficult.In this project, the possibility of tracking
such a person in a wavy sea must be examined. Videos are available of a test buoy that is a stand-in for someone at sea.
The first task of analysing such a video would be the detection of the object. Once detected and localized in the video, the
next task is to keep track of the object so that a rescue vessel can approach it. The third task is to estimate the distance of the
test buoy to the camera, which would be useful information of a rescue operation in a real situation. 


Assignment: This project focuses on the second and the third task. Given the position of the test buoy in the first frame (by manual pinpointing), track the buoy in consecutive frames, and estimate its distance in meters.


The project involve discussion on,
 camera calibration
 image stabilization
 3D vision
 tracking and prediction
 point detection/localization

The _3D_vision_manOverBoard.m file is the main project file and also find the attached video file.
